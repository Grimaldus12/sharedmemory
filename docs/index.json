This can get tedious, exspecially in the terminal. For me I really like the movement in vim so I was looking for a file manager which support that kind of navigation, so I found ranger, the cli file manager.\nRequirements  ranger optional (w3m, archiv extract tools (like unrar, 7z, atool, etc.), pdftotext, and many more (check out the github repo at the bottom)  Installation Obviously you need to install ranger.\nArch based ranger is in the official arch repo so you can install it with:\nsudo pacman -S ranger or you can install the aur package:\nyay -S ranger-git Debian based ranger is also in the offical debian repo. To install it run:\napt install ranger Configuration Like many cli programs ranger is also highly customizable. Depending on your motivation to change the default behaviour of ranger, copy at least the rc.conf into your config directory:\nmkdir -r ~/.config/ranger cp /usr/share/doc/ranger/config/rc.conf ~/.config/ranger Almost everyline in the rc.conf is documented, so you should be able to customize right away. If you want to customize even more, just copy the files form /usr/share/doc/ranger/config to your personal config folder in home.\nPersonal customization I really don't like the bookmarking system in ranger (maybe I didn't get the concept right), so I deactivated it:\nset autosave_bookmarks false set save_backtick_bookmark false # Bookmarks #map `\u0026lt;any\u0026gt; enter_bookmark %any #map '\u0026lt;any\u0026gt; enter_bookmark %any #map m\u0026lt;any\u0026gt; set_bookmark %any #map um\u0026lt;any\u0026gt; unset_bookmark %any # #map m\u0026lt;bg\u0026gt; draw_bookmarks #copymap m\u0026lt;bg\u0026gt; um\u0026lt;bg\u0026gt; `\u0026lt;bg\u0026gt; '\u0026lt;bg\u0026gt; Because I deactivated the bookmarks I needed something similar, so I added some mappings to my most visited directorys:\nmap dic cd ~/.config map did cd ~/Downloads map dis cd ~/scripts ranger does a good job with previewing all kind of files:\nset preview_images true set preview_images_method w3m filter files as-you-type:\nmap f console scout -prts%space Usage ranger has a 3 column view by default. The middle on is your \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo; column. Here you can run all kind of (vim) commands (see below for quick explanation how the controls work). Generally the first and third column will show you the content \u0026ldquo;below\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; (if you would cd into that directory) that directory. Whenever you highlight a file instead of the directory, ranger will show you a preview of that file.\nControls Everybody somewhat familiar with vim will get the controls pretty fast. I case you don't:\n   Key Description     h moves you down the file tree   l moves you up the file tree   j moves you down the file list   k moves you up the file list    Copying, deleting, etc. will work like in vim. If you want to do an action on multiply files in the directory, use space to select that file:\n   Key Description     space select/unselect file   yy copy selection/file   dd cut selection/file   : run command   v toggle (select) all files in the directory   / search/jump to search-phrase    If you want more than one tab for browsing you can easily open more:\n   Key Description     alt+1 open/switch to tab 1   alt+2 open/switch to tab 2   alt+x open/switch to tab x   q close current tab    My often used commands ranger has some neat features. I will show some of my favorites.\nBulkrenaming Just select all files you want to rename (with space oder v) and then type :bulkrename. It will open a vim buffer which will let you rename the files with vim. When you are happy with your changes just exit the buffer with :wq.\nFlat Another nice feature is the flat command. Imagine you have file structure with a good amount of files and neasted directorys. With flat -1 ranger will prefix files in nested directory with the name of this directorys and \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo; it in your working column. Now you have one list with all files and directorys, which you can excute commands on.\nFilter as you type In addition to the command above, it would be nice so somewhat filter that huge list of files. We can do that with :scout -prts. This will shrink the list as you type.\nFurther information If you want to customize ranger further more, something doesn't work or you need more information, check out the links below or open an issue on github for this post.\n arch wiki ranger github page  "
